Chords
---
24 measures = 1 section
12 steps - repeat 2x
8 steps - repeat 3x
4 steps - repeat 6x

Sections will be compressed to 12 measures
example

12 step chord progression:
1 chord/measure

8 step chord progression:
repeat 3 times, 2 chords/measure

4 step chord progression:
1 chord/measure, repeat 3 times

Melody
---

Melody 1 - 8 steps
Melody 2 - 12 steps
Melody 3 - 8 steps

24 notes split across 3 melodies for each section
1 measure = 4 beats/notes
Full melody will play out in 4 measures
24 notes for each melody will be fit into 4 measures with a note always falling on the beat and 8 extra notes falling on the backbeat

A note may only strike on 1/8 note positions (8 notes/measure). Only one melody may play a note on a strike, no melodies will play a note at the same time. This should prevent muddy and overlapping melodies.

Notes in the Melody will be from the selected key signature, Melodies will otherwise ignore the chord progression. Ordering of the notes will be fed through the same algorithm that calculates chord progressions with lengths appropriate to the Melody number (1-3).


Bassline
---

Bass notes will occur 4 times in each measure

One of the following three patterns will be used:

4 notes = 2 long, 4 short or a combination of equaling the 4 steps

short
long

root and fifth
root and third
root
third
fifth

Bass notes always follow the chord in which they occur the pattern does not change throughout the song


New Progression Algorithm
---
I - I, ii, iii, IV, V, vi, vii*
ii - IV, V vii*
iii - ii, IV, vi
IV - I, iii, V, vii*
V - I
vi - ii, IV, V, I
vii* - I, iii

1 - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
2 - 4, 5, 7
3 - 2, 4, 6
4 - 1, 3, 5, 7
5 - 1
6 - 2, 4, 5, 1
7 - 1, 3
